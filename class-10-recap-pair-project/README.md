# Class 10

## Class09 Lab Obstacles
- Putting it all together
- How to deal with the data that SQL queries send back
- Knowing what to put where...
- Organization
- Figuring out the Google Maps API
- Know the What, not the How
-


## Daily Plan
- housekeeping: new pairs!
- code review

- Model review
  - Persistence/CRUD
  - SPA & Req/res
    - requests take time & bandwidth, so let's minimize our use of them
  - use client & remote DBs to save data
  - maximize client performance by leveraging client-side storage
  - use AJAX to make small, on-demand reqs

- Controller preview
  - controller moderates between view & model
  - trigger all behavior necessary to create a response that fulfills a request
  - routing
    - use routes to derive app state & define requests
  - middleware & Express
    - middleware: functionality that has access to the req/res objects & helps prep the response
    - Express: web-app framework based in Node.js
      - installation with NPM
    - server.js: what is it?
    - static files

# Assignment for Class 10 - Pair Project

Apply what you've learned. With a pair, dive into a new code base. Learn your way around, and refactor the app with the principles you've learned over the past 2 weeks.

Here are some projects to choose from:

[Note Fellows](https://github.com/clee46/note-fellows)

[Tern-Based Combat](https://github.com/JazzyMcSuperfly/tern-based-combat)

[Welcome to Seattle](https://github.com/PeterBreen/welcome-to-seattle)

[Hacker Hangout](https://github.com/ckperez/hackerhangout)

[Budget Buddy](https://github.com/stefuhnee/budget-buddy)

[Equip](https://github.com/heyduckd/equip)

## Pairing
Work as collaborators on a single repo.
1. Make a single fork of the project you are working on.
- Add your pair as collaborator.
- Alternate driver/navigator roles with each major feature.
- Create, review, and merge a Pull Request for each feature, as you switch roles.


## User Stories
Write your own user stories as you explore the new code base.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
 - Use jQuery for all DOM and event listener code.
 - Make good use of SMACSS principles.
 - Use templates wherever possible.
 - Use mobile-first principles where you can.
 - Make the site responsive, for mobile and desktop.
