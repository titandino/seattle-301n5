## Lecture material

For each class, you'll find resources related to the lecture (like PDF of slides, video links, and example code from class) in the `lecture-code` subdirectory.

## Lab assignment

## Pair assignments

Throughout this course, you'll have a structured way to do "pair programming" with your classmates. You will have the opportunity to work with a number of your classmates, benefiting from their background and perspective, whether it's technical or otherwise.

Full instructions for what to do are found in your first pair assignment. See the `README.md` file in the `pair-assignment` folder.

Let's develop some mobile/responsive super-powers!

With a pair, make the blog responsive, so it hides the main navigation menu under a "Hamburger" icon on small screens, and unfurls to a row of tab-like links on larger screens.

Then, see how you can apply these same ideas in your portfolio!

## Independent assignment

The majority of your daily programming practice should come from working on your independent assignments. Primarily, you'll be building an online portfolio web site for yourself.

Your first independent assignment can be found in the `portfolio-assignment` subdirectory of this class folder.
